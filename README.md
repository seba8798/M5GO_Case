PIR Sensor with M5Stack, FastLED, and HTTPClient

Description
  This project demonstrates the use of an M5Stack with a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to detect motion, control an LED strip, and send motion status updates to a server. The system utilizes the FastLED library to control the LED strip and the HTTPClient library to make HTTP requests.

Features
  Motion Detection: Reads data from a PIR sensor to detect motion.
  LED Control: Updates an LED strip based on motion detection.
  HTTP Communication: Sends motion status updates to a specified server.
Components
  M5Stack: Microcontroller with a built-in display and buttons.
  PIR Sensor: Detects motion.
  LED Strip: Controlled via the FastLED library.
  WiFi Module: Connects to a network for HTTP communication.
Libraries Used
  M5Stack: For handling the M5Stack hardware.
  FastLED: For controlling the LED strip.
  WiFi: For connecting to WiFi.
  HTTPClient: For making HTTP requests.
